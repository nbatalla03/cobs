      <p class="sub_headline side-padding">A three-night event during the week of RailsConf to showcase Chicago’s enduring entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
      <p class="medium-text side-padding">
        Each night presents a snapshot of the city in a different era from the Speakeasy saloon in the Roaring ’20s, to the International World’s Fair, and the city’s longstanding legacy of storytelling. 
        Hosted by four Chicago organizations that represent our city's software craftsmanship, the three-day event allows attendees to brush shoulders with other craftsmen while re-living pieces of Chicago’s history.

      <p>Slip into this prohibition-themed event with a game night that has something for everyone. Whether you want the roaring fun of black jack and rolling dice or the more reserved play of Werewolf and Munchkin, this Speakeasy will have the resources for you to make your own fun. While playing during the game night or at networking at the after party downstairs, you'll meet a lot of other people in town.</p>

      <p>Chicago continues to embody this spirit of impressive craftsmanship and invention. At this event, you’ll be invited to participate in a LEGO hackathon, help try to make a mechanical robot, or create a bust of your own head using 3-D printing technology provided by the Field Museum. We’ll also have a local artist on hand to doodle your portrait, and a movable type to make your own press kit. While building at each booth, or at the after part downstairs, you'll have a chance to meet some of the best makers and movers and shakers in town.</p>
