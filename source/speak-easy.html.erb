      <h2>Speak Easy Event</h2>
      <p>Imagine flapper dresses and zoot suits. It’s the heart of the prohibition era, and you’re in a bar the police don’t know or can’t afford to know exists, drinking alcohol that was either brewed in a hidden warehouse or driven down from over the Canadian border. Smoke floods the room, but your focus stays sharp with the adrenaline rush and illicit thrill of being in one of Chicago’s historic speakeasy bars.</p>
      <p>During the Prohibition Era, Chicago was the engine that powered the Roaring ’20s. Although alcohol production, distribution, and consumption were all illegal, Bugs Moran and Al Capone ran opposing organized crime syndicates on Chicago’s north and south sides to keep the city’s several thousand “speakeasy” bars fully stocked. The crews manufactured illegal beer in hidden warehouses, and drove liquor down from Canada to distribute in bars that had no storefront and could only be entered through a side door with a peephole.</p>
      <p>Slip into this prohibition-themed event with a game night that has something for everyone. Whether you want the roaring fun of black jack and rolling dice or the more reserved play of Werewolf and Munchkin, this Speakeasy will have the resources for you to make your own fun.</p>
